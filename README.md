# GitHub Markdown Slideshow Generator

Some garbage code I quickly put together to create image slideshows in my GitHub
readme files. Although this does not generate a GIF file, just outputs an image sequence
then you can you use whatever tool you like to create a GIF file. I use
[gifski](https://gif.ski), you could use ffmpeg, but I didn't get good results from it.
